    "description": "Hey folks! I’ve been working with the team at Yandex Research on a way to make LLMs easier to run locally, without calibration data, GPU farms, or cloud setups.\n\nWe just published a paper on HIGGS, a data-free quantization method that skips calibration entirely. No datasets or activations required. It’s meant to help teams compress and deploy big models like DeepSeek-R1 or Llama 4 Maverick on laptops or even mobile devices.\n\nThe core idea comes from a theoretical link between per-layer reconstru",
