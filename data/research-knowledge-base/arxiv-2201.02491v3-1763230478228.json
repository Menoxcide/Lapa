    "description": "Explicit topology optimization methods have received ever-increasing interest in recent years. In particular, a 188-line Matlab code of the two-dimensional (2D) Moving Morphable Component (MMC)-based topology optimization method was released by Zhang et al. (Struct Multidiscip Optim 53(6):1243-1260, 2016). The present work aims to propose an efficient and easy-to-extend 256-line Matlab code of the MMC method for three-dimensional (3D) topology optimization implementing some new numerical techniq",
