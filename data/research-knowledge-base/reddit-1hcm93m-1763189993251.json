    "description": "I’ve been thinking about what would truly cross the threshold into AGI, and something that came up is the concept of continuous, self-directed learning. Not just an LLM responding to prompts or expanding its dataset when fine-tuned by a human, but an AI that could agentically recognize its own limitations, create reinforcement finetunes for itself, and iterate on its capabilities without external intervention.\n\nImagine this scenario:\n\nA model is trained on its initial dataset—nothing groundbreak",
