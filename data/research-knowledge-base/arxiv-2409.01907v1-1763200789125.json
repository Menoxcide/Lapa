    "description": "In the domain of Human-Computer Interaction, focus groups represent a widely utilised yet resource-intensive methodology, often demanding the expertise of skilled moderators and meticulous preparatory efforts. This study introduces the ``Focus Agent,'' a Large Language Model (LLM) powered framework that simulates both the focus group (for data collection) and acts as a moderator in a focus group setting with human participants. To assess the data quality derived from the Focus Agent, we ran five",
