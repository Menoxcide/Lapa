    "description": "4-bit quantized models generally exhibit small performance performance drops in general (with good quantization methods like AWQ / GPTQ / etc). In this work we set about to find out if there are specific tasks where quantized models start to significantly underperform. We found that this occurs on very long-context tasks with long context seeing larger performance drops relative to the full-precision models\n\n&gt;**Abstract:**  \nLarge language models (LLMs) now support context windows exceeding 1",
