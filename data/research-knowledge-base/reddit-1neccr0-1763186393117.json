    "description": "I've been thinking a lot about semantic data processing recently. A lot of the attention in AI has been on agents and chatbots (e.g., Claude Code or Claude Desktop), and I think semantic data processing is not well-served by such tools (or frameworks designed for implementing such tools, like LangChain).\n\nAs I was working on some concrete semantic data processing problems and writing a lot of Python code (to call LLMs in a for loop, for example, and then adding more and more code to do things li",
