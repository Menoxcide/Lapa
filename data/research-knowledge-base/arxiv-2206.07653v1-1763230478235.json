    "title": "A Valid Quantization of a Half-Harmonic Oscillator Field Theory",
    "description": "The usual full- and half-harmonic oscillators are turned into field theories, and that behavior is examined using canonical and affine quantization. The result leads to a valid affine quantization of the half harmonic oscillator field theory, which points toward further valid quantizations of more realistic field theory models.",
