    "description": "**TL;DR:** The paper introduces MOSAIC, a framework for collaborative learning among autonomous, agentic AI systems that operate in decentralized, dynamic environments. These agents selectively share and reuse modular knowledge (in the form of neural network masks) without requiring synchronization or centralized control.\n\nKey innovations include:\n\n* Task similarity via Wasserstein embeddings and cosine similarity to guide knowledge retrieval.\n* Performance-based heuristics to decide what, when,",
