    "description": "Hey everyone! I'm excited to share **OpenEvolve**, an open-source implementation of Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve system that I recently completed. For those who missed it, AlphaEvolve is an evolutionary coding agent that DeepMind announced in May that uses LLMs to discover new algorithms and optimize existing ones.\n\n## What is OpenEvolve?\n\nOpenEvolve is a framework that **evolves entire codebases** through an iterative process using LLMs. It orchestrates a pipeline of code generation, evaluatio",
