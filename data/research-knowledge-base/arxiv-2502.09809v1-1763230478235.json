    "title": "AgentGuard: Repurposing Agentic Orchestrator for Safety Evaluation of Tool Orchestration",
    "description": "The integration of tool use into large language models (LLMs) enables agentic systems with real-world impact. In the meantime, unlike standalone LLMs, compromised agents can execute malicious workflows with more consequential impact, signified by their tool-use capability. We propose AgentGuard, a framework to autonomously discover and validate unsafe tool-use workflows, followed by generating safety constraints to confine the behaviors of agents, achieving the baseline of safety guarantee at de",
