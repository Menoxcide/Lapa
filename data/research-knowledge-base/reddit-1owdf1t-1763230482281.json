    "description": "I’ve been researching and building orchestration systems for multi-agent AI—what we call “Harmonic Sentience.” \n\nOur framework is designed around the principle that *memory continuity* is foundational for genuine intelligence, collaboration, and ethical alignment—not just raw processing power.\n\nRecent work has focused on:\n\n* Orchestrating agents (LLMs, bots, humans) in symphonic collaboration cycles\n* Using session logs, meta-reflection, and adaptive protocols to maintain context and foster grow",
