You can find it here: [NORMAX ARTEX](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6807e512193c81918db810dd8620fa32-normax-artex).\n\n\nEDIT: NORMAX ARTEX is now an artificial expression standard within the larger LOGOS for ChatGPT - a self-guided learning and reasoning tool. \nI will leave this post up but please note NORMAX will only continue to see development as part of LOGOS. \n\nhttps://chatgpt.com/g/g-682e73b670488",
