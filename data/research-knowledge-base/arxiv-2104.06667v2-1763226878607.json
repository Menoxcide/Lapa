    "description": "Semi-supervised (SS) inference has received much attention in recent years. Apart from a moderate-sized labeled data, L, the SS setting is characterized by an additional, much larger sized, unlabeled data, U. The setting of |U| &gt;&gt; |L|, makes SS inference unique and different from the standard missing data problems, owing to natural violation of the so-called \"positivity\" or \"overlap\" assumption. However, most of the SS literature implicitly assumes L and U to be equally distributed, i.e., ",
