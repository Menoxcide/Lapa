    "description": "[Optillm](https://github.com/codelion/optillm) is an optimizing inference proxy that has over a dozen [techniques](https://github.com/codelion/optillm?tab=readme-ov-file#implemented-techniques) that aim to improve the accuracy of the responses using test-time compute. Over the last couple of months we have set several [SOTA results](https://github.com/codelion/optillm?tab=readme-ov-file#sota-results-on-benchmarks-with-optillm) using smaller and less capable models like gpt-4o-mini.   \n  \nRecentl",
