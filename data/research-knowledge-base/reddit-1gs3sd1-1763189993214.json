    "description": "Hi everyone, this is my research direction and I already would like to share the concepts to ensure that they are disseminated and researched widely in multiple parallel organizations before OpenAI or other frontier labs can show up out of the blue with a finished product and capitalize. I research open-source super intelligence, and in the meantime I have uncovered a path to AGI which I present below. I predict that Regression Training is almost solved, as indicated by the \"scaling wall\", with ",
