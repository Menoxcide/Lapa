    "description": "In healthcare intelligence, the ability to fuse heterogeneous, multi-intent information from diverse clinical sources is fundamental to building reliable decision-making systems. Large Language Model (LLM)-driven information interaction systems currently showing potential promise in the healthcare domain. Nevertheless, they often suffer from information redundancy and coupling when dealing with complex medical intents, leading to severe hallucinations and performance bottlenecks. To this end, we",
