    "description": "Hey\\~\n\nExciting news in the AI reasoning space! Using AWorld, we just built a Multi-Agent System (MAS) in 6 hours that successfully solved 5 out of 6 IMO 2025 math problems! 🎯\n\n# Research Context:\n\nThis work was inspired by the recent breakthrough paper \"Gemini 2.5 Pro Capable of Winning Gold at IMO 2025\" (Huang &amp; Yang, 2025). The authors noted that \"a multi-agent system where the strengths of different solutions can be combined would lead to stronger mathematical capability.\"\n\n# Our Innova",
