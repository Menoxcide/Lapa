    "description": "\n\n\nThe idea of AI systems engaging in recursive self-improvement is a key tenet of what some call the \"intelligence explosion\" hypothesis. Here's how it might go down within the next few years:\n\n **Baseline Capability**: First, we start with a machine learning model that's good, but not necessarily groundbreaking. The important part is that it has some capacity for basic code generation and analysis.\n\n**Guided Improvements**: Human experts will likely initiate the process by enabling the AI to o",
