    "description": "Co-author here. We’ve released a new preprint, **LLM Economist**, which explores how LLM-based agents can learn and optimize economic policy through multi-agent simulation.\n\nIn our setup, a planner agent proposes marginal tax schedules, while a population of 100 worker agents respond by choosing how much labor to supply based on their individual personas. All agents are instantiated from a calibrated skill and demographic prior and operate entirely through language—interacting via in-context mes",
