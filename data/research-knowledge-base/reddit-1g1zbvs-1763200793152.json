    "description": "I’ve been experimenting with **OpenAI’s Swarm framework** and wanted to share a little project I compiled called **openai-swarm-simple-rag**. The goal was to showcase how multi-agent orchestration can work with OpenAI’s language models to perform tasks like text analysis, keyword extraction, summarization, and document search.\n\nSwarm + RAG Github repo: [https://github.com/lesteroliver911/openai-swam-simple-rag](https://github.com/lesteroliver911/openai-swam-simple-rag)\n\n**What is OpenAI Swarm?**",
