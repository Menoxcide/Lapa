    "description": " \n#🔦 Ray Tracing Meets Large Language Models: A New Frontier in Neural Computation\n\nIntroduction \n\nRay tracing and large language models (LLMs) come from very different worlds.\nRay tracing is a graphics and physics technique that simulates how light interacts with objects to produce realistic images.\nLLMs, on the other hand, are massive statistical systems trained on text data to generate and reason about language.\n\nAt first glance, they seem unrelated — but conceptually, both deal with propaga",
