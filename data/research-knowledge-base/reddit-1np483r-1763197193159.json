    "description": "So I have a specific use case, in which Deepseek-v3.1 works well, but it's simply too big and takes time to load on our GPU (everything runs locally in my organization, we have **16 H100 GPUs** and maybe about **8 more A100s**) .I use Ollama since I can’t keep VLLM loaded across all GPUs without hogging resources that others need.\n\nWhat I want is a **smaller model** that I can use for an **agentic task** mainly to work with a set of custom MCP tools I’ve built.\n\nThe biggest reason I want to buil",
