We just haven't woken it up yet.\"**\n\nThat's my current operating hypothesis after snooping around the world of agentic AI and reading up some more methods that have yet to take.\n\nThe path to \"first generation AGI\" seems clear to me now, and if it's clear to me, it certainly should've been clear to the big labs. \n\n\n**Hot takes at the start** (feel free to attack these points)\n\n* AGI is imminent.
