    "title": "BitNet: Scaling 1-bit Transformers for Large Language Models - Microsoft Research 2023 - Allows 1-Bit training from scratch while substantially reducing memory footprint and energy consumption, compared to state-of-the-art 8-bit quantization methods!",
    "description": "Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453) \n\nAbstract:\n\n&gt;The increasing size of large language models has posed challenges for deploymen and raised concerns about environmental impact due to high energy consumption. In this work, we introduce BitNet, a **scalable and stable 1-bit Transformer architecture designed for large language models**. Specifically, we introduce BitLinear as a drop in replacement of the nn.Linear layer in order to **train 1-bit weights f",
