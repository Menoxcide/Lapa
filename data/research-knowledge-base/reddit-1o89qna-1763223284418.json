    "description": "I've been exploring a lot of the autonomous agent frameworks out there, and I noticed a common pattern: many of them operate on a linear \"to-do list\" model. They execute tasks sequentially, which is great for simple workflows but struggles with complex problems where steps have branching dependencies.\n\nI wanted to build something that could handle this more complex reality. So, I created **LLM Agent X**, an open-source framework that models and executes tasks as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n\n",
