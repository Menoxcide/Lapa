    "description": "Hey everyone! 👋\n\nI'm excited to share OptiLLMBench, a new benchmark specifically designed to test how different inference optimization techniques (like ReRead, Chain-of-Thought, etc.) can improve LLM performance without any fine-tuning.\n\nFirst results with Gemini 2.0 Flash show promising improvements:\n\n* ReRead (RE2): +5% accuracy while being \\~14% faster\n* Chain-of-Thought Reflection: +5% boost\n* Base performance: 51%\n\nThe benchmark tests models across:\n\n* GSM8K math word problems\n* MMLU Math\n",
