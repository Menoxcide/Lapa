    "description": "I have released the current build of **OM3 (Open Machine Model 3)** for public review:  \n [https://github.com/A1CST/OM3/tree/main](https://github.com/A1CST/OM3/tree/main)\n\nThis is an experimental research project. It is not a production model.  \nThe intent is to test whether a continuous modular architecture can support emergent pattern learning in real time without external resets or offline batch training.\n\n# Model Overview\n\n**OM3 engine structure:**\n\n* Continuous main loop (no manual reset cy",
