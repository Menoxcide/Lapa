    "title": "Cerebras CePO: Supercharging Llama-3.3 70B with Test-Time Reasoning",
    "description": "CePO (Cerebras Planning and Optimization) is a framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of the Llama family of large language models through advanced test-time computation techniques. By leveraging step-by-step reasoning, comparative analysis of multiple solutions, and structured output formats, CePO enables Llama models, particularly Llama-3.3 70B, to surpass larger counterparts like Llama-3.1 405B in tasks requiring logical reasoning, coding, and mathematical problem-solving.\n\n",
