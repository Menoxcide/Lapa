    "description": "When I launched NLP Cloud in early 2020, optimizing inference of our AI models in production was a nightmare.  \n  \nSince then, so much progress has been made...  \n  \nNow machine learning engineers can leverage lots of advanced techniques to considerably improve the speed and throughput of their LLMs, like:  \n\\- continuous batching  \n\\- tensor parallelism  \n\\- sequence parallelism  \n\\- multi-query attention  \n\\- FlashAttention  \n\\- KV caching  \n\\- PagedAttention  \n\\- quantization / distillation  ",
