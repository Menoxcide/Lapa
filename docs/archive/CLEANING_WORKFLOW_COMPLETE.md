## 📝 Next Steps (Optional)

### Future Cleaning Operations
The following operations were identified but deferred for safety:
1. **Dependency Pruning** - Requires `depcheck` analysis and comprehensive testing
2. **Import Path Standardization** - Requires TypeScript compilation verification
3. **Dead Code Removal** - Requires static analysis and dynamic usage verification

These can be executed in future cleaning cycles with proper analysis and testing.
