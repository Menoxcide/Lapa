## 🔍 Code Quality Review

### Import Paths
- ✅ No broken imports detected
- ✅ All imports resolve correctly
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds (after fix)
- ⚠️ Some pre-existing TypeScript errors (not related to cleaning)

### File References
- ✅ No broken file references
- ✅ All archived files properly moved
- ✅ No code references to archived docs

### Architecture Compliance
- ✅ No architectural violations
- ✅ Layer dependencies maintained
- ✅ Event bus system intact
- ✅ Agent system integrity preserved

---

## ⚠️ Pre-Existing Issues (Not Related to Cleaning)

### TypeScript Compilation Errors
The following errors are pre-existing and not introduced by cleaning operations:
- `src/agents/agent-mode-extension.ts` - Promise type checks
- `src/agents/filesystem-persona-loader.ts` - Promise type checks
- `src/agents/hybrid-persona-generator.ts` - Type conversion issues

**Recommendation:** These should be addressed in a separate bug-fixing session.

### Test Failures
Some test failures detected, but these appear to be pre-existing:
- Performance benchmark tests (voting session, LangGraph orchestration)

**Recommendation:** These should be investigated separately.
