# LAPA God-Level Master Plan: SwarmOS Edition Workflow (v1.3)

## Executive Summary

This master plan outlines a strategic workflow for the LAPA project that coordinates across multiple specialized modes to accomplish a complex multi-phase validation and improvement process. The plan breaks down an 11-step workflow into logical subtasks with appropriate mode assignments based on each mode's capabilities. For v1.3 SwarmOS, it extends to collaborative, multimodal, and ecosystem phases (19-21).

## 11-Step Workflow Breakdown with Mode Assignments (v1.2.2 Core)

### 1. Git Staging/Commit Analysis with Tool Identification
**Assigned Mode:** `architect`
**Reasoning:** The architect mode is best suited for analyzing repository state and identifying tools used in commits. It has capabilities for system design and planning which are essential for understanding the project's evolution.

### 2. Research Optimal Human+AI Communication Language
**Assigned Mode:** `docs-specialist`
**Reasoning:** The documentation specialist mode is specifically designed for creating clear, comprehensive documentation and understanding communication patterns. This mode excels at analyzing both internal and user-facing communication needs.

### 3. Create Implementation Strategy for Chosen Language
**Assigned Mode:** `architect`
**Reasoning:** The architect mode is responsible for system design and planning optimizations. Creating an implementation strategy aligns with its core capabilities of technology selection and architecture planning.

### 4. Documentation Review and Consolidation
**Assigned Mode:** `docs-specialist`
**Reasoning:** The documentation specialist mode is specifically designed for reviewing, organizing, and consolidating documentation. Its expertise in knowledge retrieval and documentation generation makes it the ideal choice for this task.

### 5. Phase Summary Analysis and Schema Generation
**Assigned Mode:** `code-reviewer`
**Reasoning:** The code reviewer mode specializes in detailed analysis and accuracy checking. Generating schemas from phase summaries requires careful analysis and validation, which aligns with this mode's capabilities.

### 6. Phase Completion Validation Against Project Documents
**Assigned Mode:** `code-reviewer`
**Reasoning:** Validating completion against project documents requires the detailed analysis and accuracy checking capabilities of the code reviewer mode. This mode ensures that all requirements have been properly met.

### 7. Code Implementation Verification
**Assigned Mode:** `code-reviewer`
**Reasoning:** The code reviewer mode is specifically designed for cod...(truncated 2418 characters)...esting Validation - test-engineer]

Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Analysis and Research (Steps 1-4)

Duration: 2-3 days
Focus: Understanding current state, researching communication patterns, and planning implementation
Deliverables: Git analysis report, communication language guidelines, implementation strategy document, consolidated documentation

Phase 2: Development and Validation (Steps 5-7)

Duration: 3-4 days
Focus: Generating schemas, validating phase completion, and verifying code implementations
Deliverables: Generated schemas, validation reports, code verification summaries

Phase 3: Quality Assurance (Steps 8-9)

Duration: 2-3 days
Focus: Debugging issues and validating testing coverage
Deliverables: Debugging reports, alignment documentation, testing coverage analysis

Phase 4: Finalization and Documentation (Steps 10-11)

Duration: 1 day
Focus: Coordinating final commit and updating foundational documents
Deliverables: Final git commit, updated project documentation

Phase 5: SwarmOS Extensions (Steps 12-20, v1.3)

Duration: 8-10 weeks
Focus: Collaborative, multimodal, ecosystem features
Deliverables: WebRTC sessions, vision/voice agents, marketplace registry

Success Metrics

Repository Health: Clean git history with properly documented changes
Communication Quality: Established communication standards adopted across the project
Implementation Completeness: All planned features implemented according to strategy
Documentation Standards: Comprehensive, consolidated documentation meeting quality standards
Code Quality: Verified implementations with minimal bugs
Testing Coverage: Comprehensive test coverage validation
Process Efficiency: Smooth coordination between specialized modes
SwarmOS Metrics: 95% multi-user session uptime, 90% multimodal accuracy, 100K marketplace skills

Risk Mitigation

Mode Switching Failures: Implement fallback mechanisms using the orchestrator mode to manage transitions
Communication Gaps: Use the docs-specialist mode to maintain clear documentation of decisions and processes
Quality Issues: Leverage multiple validation steps through code-reviewer mode to catch issues early
Coordination Challenges: Utilize the orchestrator mode's workflow coordination capabilities to manage dependencies
v1.3 Scaling Risks: Beta test SwarmOS with 100 users; fallback to v1.2.2 for stability

This master plan provides a structured approach to executing the 11-step workflow while leveraging the specialized capabilities of each mode in the LAPA system. The plan emphasizes clear responsibilities, dependencies, and success metrics to ensure effective execution of the complex multi-phase validation and improvement process. v1.3 extensions position LAPA as the dev economy's nervous system.
