# Workflow Documentation

This directory contains all agent persona action workflows, broken down into focused, concise documents for token efficiency.

## Available Workflows

- Purpose and use case
- Agent chain sequence
- Detailed step-by-step process
- Quality gates for each step
- Completion criteria

Workflows are designed for autonomous execution with NEURAFORGE orchestration.
