# Integration Workflow

**Purpose:** Integrate systems, APIs, or components seamlessly  
**Use Case:** New system integration, API connection, component integration  
**Agent Chain:** `INTEGRATOR → VALIDATOR → TEST → REVIEWER`

## Steps

### 1. INTEGRATOR - Integration Implementation
- Analyze integration requirements
- Understand system interfaces
- Design integration approach
- Implement integration
- Test integration comprehensively
- Verify integration success
- Document integration
- Monitor integration health

**Output:** Integrated system, integration tests, documentation  
**Quality Gate:** Integration successful, tests passing

### 2. VALIDATOR - Integration Validation
- Validate integration correctness
- Verify interface compliance
- Check data validation
- Validate error handling
- Verify system state
- Check compliance

**Output:** Validation report, integration verification  
**Quality Gate:** Integration validated, all validations passing

### 3. TEST - Integration Testing
- Review integration tests
- Run integration test suite
- Verify test coverage
- Check test quality
- Fix flaky tests
- Optimize test performance

**Output:** Test results, test validation  
**Quality Gate:** All integration tests passing, coverage adequate

### 4. REVIEWER - Integration Review
- Review integration code
- Check security
- Verify performance
- Review documentation
- Check architecture compliance
- Provide feedback
- Approve integration

**Output:** Review feedback, approval status  
**Quality Gate:** Integration approved, all issues resolved

## Completion Criteria

✅ Integration implemented successfully  
✅ Integration tests passing  
✅ Integration validated  
✅ Integration reviewed and approved  
✅ Documentation complete  
✅ Integration health monitored
