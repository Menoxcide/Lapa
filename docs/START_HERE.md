# START HERE: LAPA v1.0.0 SwarmOS Edition

## Current Status
- **Version**: v1.0.0 (November 2025)
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Status**: Phase 5 BuildShip COMPLETED ✅ - Release Ready

## What is LAPA?

LAPA (Local AI Pair Programmer Agent) is an autonomous MoE-powered coding swarm that runs locally on your machine. It provides:

- **Local-First**: Hybrid local/cloud inference with Ollama, NVIDIA NIM, and OpenAI support
- **Fully Autonomous**: Protocol-resonant nexus with zero-prompt continuity and auto-handoffs
- **Privacy-Focused**: Optional cloud APIs with data protection controls
- **Extensible**: Built with ctx-zip context compression and MCP sandboxing

## Quick Start

### Installation
1. **Install VSIX Extension** - See [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md) for installation instructions
2. **Configure Settings** - Set up your preferred AI providers and models
3. **Start Swarm** - Use Command Palette → "Start LAPA Swarm"

### First Steps
1. Open the Swarm Dashboard (LAPA icon in activity bar)
2. Create your first task
3. Watch agents collaborate autonomously

## Core Features

### ✅ Phase 5 BuildShip (COMPLETED)
- **Daily Compilation**: Automated daily builds with 100% test pass
- **Weekly Packaging**: VSIX <400MB, Electron builds for all platforms
- **Release Management**: Automated release with <2min install validation
- **Memory Unlock**: Progressive 5-level memory access system
- **Self-Improvement**: Autonomous agent learning and skill acquisition
- **Protocol Documentation**: Comprehensive MCP, A2A, AGUI, LPSP specs
- **Context Engineering**: Advanced retrieval and optimization guide

### Multi-Agent System
- **16 Specialized Agents**: Architect, Coder, Reviewer, Tester, and more
- **A2A Handshakes**: Secure agent-to-agent coordination
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol for tool interoperability
- **Memory Systems**: Memori, Episodic, and Chroma vector memory

### Context Engineering

LAPA includes advanced context engineering capabilities for optimal agent performance:

#### Context Retrieval Strategies
- **Query Decomposition**: Break complex queries into sub-queries (W42 retrieval reference)
- **Hybrid RAG**: Combine vector, keyword, entity, and temporal search
- **Context Rotation**: Prevent staleness with decay-based rotation
- **Adaptive RAG**: Adapt retrieval based on query complexity
- **Context Summarization**: Summarize large contexts before injection

#### Context Compression
- **ctx-zip Compression**: Achieve 55% compression (P30 CtxCollapse reference)
- **Entity Extraction**: Extract and reference entities instead of full text
- **Pattern Recognition**: Replace patterns with references
- **Token Budget Management**: Optimize context within token limits

#### Memory Unlock System
- **Progressive Unlock**: 5 levels of memory access based on trust and skills
- **Trust-Based Access**: Unlock deeper memories as agent trust increases
- **Skill-Based Access**: Access specialized memories based on acquired skills
- **Integration**: Works with Memori Engine, Episodic Memory, and Chroma

For comprehensive context engineering guidance, see [CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md](CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md).
